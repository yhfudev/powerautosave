## What it is

This project includes the documents and scripts to set up servers in a home network to sleep when they're idle, and wake up automatically when a request arrives without human involvement. It can be used for a NAS/media/backup server that requires 24/7 uptime. As an example, one of the author's PC servers draws about 100W of power when active and drops to 8W when in an idle state.

The basic idea is to put a server into a suspend state when idle is detected on the host; the router, which is installed with a WOL script, will send out a WOL (Wake-on-LAN) packet once it detects another host initiating an access request to the suspended server. The server will then power on when it receives the WOL packet.

In the rest of the document, we'll set up a WOL solution for a server host running Linux (Ubuntu), and an OpenWrt router in a home network. The Linux server (Ubuntu) will go to sleep when idle and be wakened up by the WOL packet sent by the OpenWrt router when there's a service request from other hosts.

## Setup WOL on Linux server (Ubuntu)

The network interface card requires the settings for Wake-on-LAN (WOL). The best place to configure the card would be the config file for `udev`, for example:
```bash
if ! which ethtool ; then apt install -y ethtool; fi
IFNAME=eno1
MAC=$(ifconfig $IFNAME | grep ether | awk '{print $2}')
sed -e "s|${IFNAME}:|net0:|" -i /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
cat >>/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules<<EOF
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ATTR{address}=="${MAC}", NAME="net0", RUN+="`which ethtool` -s %k wol g"
EOF
```

## Setup suspend+hibernation hybrid mode (Ubuntu)
This step involves setting the host to a suspend state and hibernating the host if it remains inactive for a pre-defined interval, to avoid potential data loss due to power outages.

To enable hibernation, a swap partition on the HDD will be utilized, and the data in RAM will be dumped to the swap partition. Therefore, the size of the swap partition should be larger than the size of the RAM memory.

It is also essential to avoid using an SSD as the swap partition to minimize the number of writes to the flash drive and prolong its lifespan.

To configure the hibernate time, modify the configuration file located at /etc/systemd/sleep.conf. This file allows you to set the interval between the suspend state and hibernation.
```bash
sed -e 's|#HibernateDelaySec=.*$|HibernateDelaySec=180min|' -i /etc/systemd/sleep.conf

# OR
cat >>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf<<EOF
[Sleep]
HibernateDelaySec=180min
EOF
```

test it:
```
sudo systemctl suspend-then-hibernate
```

Change the Lid Close Action with the following command:
```
# /etc/systemd/logind.conf
HandleLidSwitch=suspend-then-hibernate
```
Restart the systemd-logind service:
```
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
```


Set the swap partition in the GRUB config file /etc/default/grub:
```bash
blkid /dev/sdaX

# /etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash resume=UUID=5c03967e-b9fe-4a2e-8501â€“05002aa51dd6"

sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
sudo update-grub
```



## Install powerautosave.sh on Linux server (Ubuntu)

powerautosave.sh is a script designed to put the server into sleep mode when the server is idle. The script will suspend the host when the specified conditions are met:

- there is nobody logged into the system.
- the CPU is idle, based on the PAS_CPU_THRESHOLD.
- the HDD has low IO, based on the PAS_HD_THRESHOLD.
- the network has low traffic, based on the PAS_NET_THRESHOLD.
- the system has been idle for a long time, defined by the PAS_IDLE_WAIT_TIME.

```bash
# install packages:
apt update && apt -y install bash prips ipcalc uuid-runtime
apt -y install dstat
apt -y install pcp

# install script
DN_CONF="/etc/powerautosave"
sudo mkdir "${DN_CONF}"
sudo cp powerautosave.service powerautosave.sh libshrt.sh "${DN_CONF}"
cd "${DN_CONF}"
sudo chmod 755 *.sh

# the host ip list, the server will enter to sleep if none is ping-able.
touch "${DN_CONF}/pas-ip.list"
# echo "10.1.1.160/24" >> "${DN_CONF}/pas-ip.list"

# the processes list, the server will enter to sleep if none is running.
touch "${DN_CONF}/pas-proc.list"
echo "wget scp rsync dstat" | sudo tee "${DN_CONF}/pas-proc.list"

# setup the waiting time before sleep in config file
cat >> "${DN_CONF}/powerautosave.conf" <<EOF
# default waiting time before go to sleep
PAS_IDLE_WAIT_TIME=900 # second
PAS_CPU_THRESHOLD=88   # percent
PAS_HD_THRESHOLD=900   # Kbytes
PAS_NET_THRESHOLD=4000 # bytes
EOF

# setup service
sudo cp powerautosave.service /etc/systemd/system/powerautosave.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable powerautosave
sudo systemctl restart powerautosave
sudo systemctl status powerautosave

journalctl -u powerautosave -b
```

To reload config:
```bash
kill -s SIGUSR1 $(ps -ef | grep owerautosave | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')
```


## Install wolonconn.sh on Linux router (OpenWrt)

The script "wolonconn.sh" serves the purpose of sending Wake-on-LAN (WOL) packets to activate the server once a connection is detected on the OpenWrt router.

To ensure proper functionality, it is important to verify that the request packet from the client to the server host passes through the OpenWrt router. The server can either be located behind the router if the packet originates from the outside (Internet), or in a separate virtual LAN if the packet is from a client also behind the router.

Additionally, the server host should be listed in the "DHCP and DNS -- Static Leases" table, which includes its host name, IP address, and MAC address. This listing allows the program to query the MAC address and interface required for the server host, ensuring that the WOL packets are sent to the correct destination and the server is properly activated upon connection detection.


```bash
# install packages:
opkg update; opkg install bash curl conntrack owipcalc etherwake uuidgen

# install script
cp wolonconn.sh /etc/wolonconn.sh
chmod 755 /etc/wolonconn.sh

# setup config
rm -f /etc/config/wolonconn
touch /etc/config/wolonconn
uci set wolonconn.basic='config'
uci set wolonconn.basic.filetemp='/tmp/wol-on-conn.temp'
uci set wolonconn.basic.filelog='/tmp/wol-on-conn.log'

uci add wolonconn server
uci set wolonconn.@server[-1].host='myhostname'
uci set wolonconn.@server[-1].ports='22 80 443'
#uci set wolonconn.@server[-1].interface='br-lan'
#uci set wolonconn.@server[-1].mac='11:22:33:44:55:01'

uci add wolonconn server
uci set wolonconn.@server[-1].host='10.1.1.23'
uci set wolonconn.@server[-1].ports='22 80'

uci add wolonconn client
uci set wolonconn.@client[-1].iprange='10.1.0.0/16'

# uci revert wolonconn
uci commit wolonconn

uci show wolonconn
```

add the line to the file `/etc/rc.local`, before 'exit'

```bash
# /etc/rc.local
/etc/wolonconn.sh &

exit
```


To reload config:
```bash
kill -s SIGUSR1 $(ps | grep wolonconn | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}')
```
